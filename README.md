# Sample Projects

**I'm sure there is a better way to structure this.  Please submit suggestions**

This is where I will put my sample projects, just for fun, in many different languages.

Any challenges are welcome, and suggestions would be great!

Some java projects may require a library named **objectdraw**.  This can be found with a quick google search.

Note: I am attempting to use OOP more and more, so there will be what could be seen as too many functions.
